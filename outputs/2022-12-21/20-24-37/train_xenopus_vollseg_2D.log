[2022-12-21 20:24:40,469][tensorflow][WARNING] - AutoGraph could not transform <function _mean_or_not.<locals>.<lambda> at 0x15161698f1c0> and will run it as-is.
Cause: could not parse the source code of <function _mean_or_not.<locals>.<lambda> at 0x15161698f1c0>: found multiple definitions with identical signatures at the location. This error may be avoided by defining each lambda on a single line and with unique argument names. The matching definitions were:
Match 0:
lambda x: K.mean(x, axis=-1)

Match 1:
lambda x: x

To silence this warning, decorate the function with @tf.autograph.experimental.do_not_convert
